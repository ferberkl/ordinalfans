Ordinal FANS R Packages
Oridinal FANS is a method for fitting ordinal response models in high-dimensional data settings. Two approaches were implemented to develop this method. The code for the first approach has the suffix binFANS in the file names. The code for the second approach has the suffix ordinalfans in the file names but also includes the files with POboost in the name.
